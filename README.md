# Ignition

Ignition is going to be a simple application that can grow into many different things.

Ignition to me is going to be a simple database connected up with OOP PHP with a very basic and simple look that can be accessed on a mobile browser as well as a desktop browser too. 

It will take into acount measurements of the body to start off with and have interactive charts that can be taken from a JS framework.

The next steps would be to make it more dynamic and interactive with ore features.
